## Plan
- Use only interaction (slash, buttons, etc)
- Armor Set, e.g. "Wizard Armor Set" or "Knight Armor Set" (Technically not really "Armor", boosts certain stats and give certain effect when certain amount of armor set type matched, e.g. 4 Armor Set of "Healer" type gives player debuff on magic damage but buff healing ability)
- No character-class (Replaced by "Armor Set")
- Pokemon-like turn based combat (Better agility = Move registered first)
- Allow player to have 3+ characters
- Traveling system (maybe? for grinding level, certain area better for grinding exp or grinding gold/coin)
